Greetings MoonshadeDigi Team!

  This document will provide readers and team members with a map of Moonshade's 'Digital Garden' resources, which will act as a directory. 
As we expand our current projects and set out to break new ground the 'DIGIGAR'* will be the project that will receive the most consistent updates out of everything we currently have in development. 

Each 'DIGIGAR' or 'Digital Garden' will receive several years of development. "As of Q1 '25," The "Atlas of Ithonia" 'DIGIGAR' is the only digital garden offering currently available. This project will connect the "Kass: Iridescent Akai," "Project Viras," & "Lumin" IPs and canon. Our focus for 2025 will be the expansion of the "Atlas Of Ithonia" digigar with dossiers, mind maps, visual assets, concept work, apps, video games & more. We aim to provide our users with the most seamless and engaging experience possible as we rollout our new IP offerings. We want to provide our audience with the tools to define their experience with our content. As these projects expand, our worldbuilding content will be announced as developments become available. In Q2 of 2025, our discord will launch along with our crowdfunding campaigns. The discord will allow volunteers to assist in the development of the project, as such, each contribution will be rewarded with NFTs or crypto tokens that will increase in value with the growth of our projects.
