# Atlas
___
Atlas came into existence as the final years of The NeoRev Wars drew to a close. It was heralded as the "last bastion of humanity" seen as 
a beacon to the entire world after decades of wonton destruction and global devastation left by in the wake of the wars. 
It began as a place of refuge, a sort of neutral zone as it was agreed that such a place would be necessary to prevent 
the organic lifeforms from being extinguished. A hyper massive megastructure that was initially fashioned crudely out of the scraps, 
rubble, & debris left over from the devastation. The construction commenced on the continent of Raythhelsoth, known affectionately as 
Kithal by those who called it home before. 
---
In the second half of the wars it had expanded to 4 other continent with the use of land bridges. That expansion is what led to the 
formation of Atlas proper. At the onset of the second half of these wars the people of Atlas had grown to be a force too influential to 
ignore. The _**Negetien Veertine**_ were by this time deeply embroiled in an internal conflict. As these issues reached critical mass the 
Veertine disbanded. They split into 10 conglomerates. Electing to heed the wisdom of the Atlasian populace, prior to being identified as 
such, chose not to self identify. Instead, allowing each conglomerate to be distinguished as individual entities. 

These conglomerates were so powerful that even their very existence was easily concealed from the general public. It was understood that 
they were the pillars of society and were free to do as they pleased. The adoption of this system saw to it that the NeoRev wars became 
something of a spectacle. They were an opportunity for peace. Hence, being known as the "Rev" period.
Atlas is a megalopolis that has become the last place on Celis that is habitable for organic lifeforms. It is essentially a 
megastructure that was build to be a continent.
    
There are a total of 2,685 unique districts that call Atlas home. These districts house a population of 10 billion organic* lifeforms.

## Akai:
(As seen in "Kass: Iridescent Akai" & "Wandering Times In Akai: Todoke")
-----
Akai is a massive city built atop a megastructure nestled between two district nodes that are located in the southern Fellstorne region of 
Atlas' western hemisphere. Established several years prior to the dustup of the NeoRev Wars.

### Daniel Shepherd
    Former Naval general Daniel “Kingfish” Shepherd is what you would call one of a kind. In the early days of the Neo Rev wars 
    Shepherd single handedly took out 5 battalions during a coastal assault defense. That day he was one of 25 soldiers left from 
    their company of 157 troops. Each took to the defense of the Floridian coast with great zeal and extreme prejudice.

    Without this outrageously astounding feat the “day of no light” may very well have been the end of the US. Sadly his defense left 
    him and the remainder of his company mortality wounded. Beating back over 5,000 soldiers is no simple task with only 25. However, 
    thanks to having opted into the Navy’s experimental augment test Shepherd was able to survive nearly every bone being broken in his 
    body hundreds of bullet wounds and enough lacerations to prevent him from moving a single muscle.

    Following his total body reconstruction, Shepherd became an infamous war hero, and a general; 
    known to end battles with his presence alone. 




### Marcus Krell
    Marcus “Sureshot” Krell is an elite sniper turned military general. In the earliest days of the Neo Rev wars Krell was considering 
    retirement. After the numerous attacks that occurred on the “day of no light” however including several bombings in his home town he 
    couldn’t stand idly by. Krell immediately re-enlisted moving up through the ranks to become one of the generals responsible for 
    bringing the war to a close.
    
    After retirement Krell considered allowing himself to rest and prepare to enter his twilight years. Once hearing about his old friend 
    General Jones’s injuries and recovery due to the use of cybernetics he decided to stay close to her and acquire cybernetics of his own.
    This ensured that he’d extend his lifespan to keep his old friend company and to put her mind at ease. Krell knew Jones hated 
    cybernetics so someone had to keep the master tactician grounded.



### Releigna Jones
    Releigna "Rebel" Jones was once a highly decorated war hero, known for her strategic brilliance and fearless leadership on the 
    battlefield. After a devastating injury left her with severe burns and trauma, she was given cybernetic implants to replace her 
    damaged body parts and enhance her physical abilities.

    Now retired from the military, General Jones runs a large sector of Atlas, a sprawling megacity that is home to billions of people. 
    She uses her extensive knowledge of warfare and her advanced cybernetic enhancements to maintain order and protect the city from 
    threats, both external and internal.

    Despite her fearsome reputation and formidable abilities, General Jones is known to be fair and just, and she is respected by the 
    people under her command. She may not always be easy to work with, but she is a force to be reckoned with, and she will stop at 
    nothing to keep Atlas safe.





### Durand Nyx
    Born two years following the conclusion of the Neo Rev wars Nyx is the child of two of the most renown heroes of the war. 
    When Nyx was just 5 though both of his parents were killed in an assassination turned terrorist attack. Being the last surviving 
    member of his family and having witnessed first hand the horrific scenes of that day, the 3 kings trained Durand in every necessary 
    skill to make him a fitting king. He now reigns alongside his adopted uncles and aunt as they are the only remaining family that he 
    has left.
    Nyx has committed himself to ridding Atlas of all violent crimes. In an effort to ensure that no child must suffer like he did all 
    those years ago.

## Heavenly Arms

The Inter-Realm
The Interrealm is an intermediary space that encompasses the space outside of dimensional space. This space does not abide by the 
conventional laws of physics. It is however, possible to find localized pockets within this space that have a relatively similar function 
to physics based space. These pockets can be found just outside of a dimensional rift. 
The Inter-Realm, more commonly known as "Interspace" is a pocket dimension accessible through egg-like ethereal disks known as "Rifts." 
Each Rift is a portal that can transport the user to various regions in the Inter-Realm. It was originally hypothesized that the Rifts were 
wormholes. However, after several expeditions scientists began to realize that the Rifts pointed to a dimension that was an entirely 
separate space altogether.  

This discovery was made when select areas were found to have comparable atmospheric conditions to those of Celis. That is how the regions 
most favorable to organic matter came to be identified as "Goldilocks Radius Zones." The Goldilocks Radius of every Rift was rarely ever 
the same. For a time this fact allowed for trade between each region to flourish. Unfortunately it was not to last. Once the conglomerates 
developed technologies more conducive to navigating the Inter-Realms they began to stake their claim.

### Augmentation

  _**Cyberiology**_
  _____
  Augmentation Cy-Biology: 
        Augments are incorporated into the body by mimicking the function of the body part the augment is set to take the place of. 
        This is achieved through vibration of the augment and release of biological molecules that are modified with “SynthGen” technology.         Through the 
        use of a process known as “protein shifting” the augment is able to integrate into the cellular structures of the body without              raising alarm or causing infection. Thus avoiding an undesirable or adverse reaction from the body’s immune system through                  synthesis. 
        This is achieved through a complex and delicate technique in which Eosinophil, Natural Killer, Mast, & Basophil (white blood) 
        cells are nullified by the augment. 
  
>  Upon nullification these cells are then rapidly replicated, modified, and then sent out; returning to body. This process leverages the 
>  chemicals released primarily by manipulating the Natural Killer & Eosinophil cell’s chemical release structure. The key components that 
>  tie this process together are the Micro & Macro “Ferinial” cells. 
 
 
 
 
The Micro Ferinials are responsible for mimicking benign viruses. This allows the white blood cells to operate in a normative manner. 
It doubles as a regulatory mechanism to control & monitor compliance of the modified cells. Utilizing the Macro Ferinial cells, which are 
nearly identical to Macrophages and Dendritic cells. The Macro Ferinial Cells electrically interact with the Macrophages and Dendritic 
cells, releasing chemicals containing a dual action agent. The agents act as T Cells initially, responsible for collaborating with organic 
T cells during the antigen phase. 

These systems range from large to small scale operations acting synchronously and harmoniously with the bodies natural processes. This 
bio-organic system wouldn’t be possible without the Ferinial cells as these assist in the modification of the white blood cells and 
propagation of identical T & B cells which develop antibodies against the misnomer virus cells released by the augmentation. Frequency of 
these processes relies heavily upon the specifications of the augment and varies from unit to unit. This is what makes compounds such as 
Celmenodrome so useful as they regulate and stabilize the effects of the synthetic synthesis. Lending itself to the integration of the 
augment by the body. 
However, this process can become quite intensive upon the body and can lead to mor hazardous infections. Requiring stronger doses of 
Celmenodrome or other antibiotics/muonic substances entirely. By utilizing a combination of nanotechnology and subatomic resonance.

### "HE-AOE" Weapons -
"HE-AOE" weapons, or, "High Efficiency Area Of Effect" weapons were militaristic weapons program developments that were geared toward the total devastation of a particular area of interest.  

The first notable example of this was during the 2nd cycle of the NeoRev Wars, from 2101 through 2105 where an intense campaign of the war saw the first use of a "HE-AOE" leaving 15% of the surface of Celis totally inhospitable. 
These weapons would gradually increase in scale, and by the end of the NeoRev Wars, would be responsible for the destruction of over 85% of the surface of Celis. Resulting in the mandatory habitation of Atlas imposed upon the population of Celis. 
There were no alternatives, no debates, it was Atlas, or eminent doom. No being, organic or otherwise could survive the Abyssal rainstorms that ravaged the damaged lands of Celis. When an HE-AOE weapon was pressed into action the only recourse was a commitment to a M.A.D. policy and the enforcement of it.
Ithonia
Ithonia is accessible from Celis by traversing the Interrealms. In Subsector "S-DZI-3504, Vector 2.01-a" or the "Astral Cloud" region, noted for a distinct occurrence where most realms consist of gaseous realms. Making travel to and through them is quite a precarious task. Expeditions had to be planned extensively before receiving authorization to execute operations. 






An example of this would be when the Sparrows failed to migrate the majority of their team to Ithonia before the '"Fallen Tenshi" Incident' that saw nearly all of the Sparrows' ranks decimated, atomized in the wake of the battle between Malcolm & V, orchestrated by Byte, as seen in Obsidian Atlas Episode 1 & 2.
