# Warp Skipper


Moonshade's first asset release the ["Warp Skipper"](https://todoketori.itch.io/warp-skipper-v-18) is a project that is currently in
production and draws on 'Lumin' & project "Light Bearer" canon. 

- Description:
Warp Skipper v. 1.8

"On a bad day, this baby can go 0 to 20 parsecs in seconds, if you're up against one of the intergalactic coteries 
you'll need this! I guarantee it." 

This asset came from one of our dev sprint meetings for one of our projects. 
Between Project Light Bearer & Virais we're looking at a pretty serious development cycle. 
In the meantime, we'll release asset packs as resources become available. 
we want to thank all of you in advance for your support in our endeavors!!

Character Sheet
Modular
Optimized for RPG Maker MV, MZ

Can be used for personal & commercial projects!
The warp skipper is a concept piece from our new IPs, 
as such it comes with its own 'in universe' canon & lore.

Certain assets are reserved for supporters, the assets that have been made available can be used in both commercial and personal projects.

{As an aside, the ship utilizes a "Negima" Powered 'engine' known (in-universe) as a "Lumin Drive." 
A rare and coveted technology that has remained a mystery to galactic civilizations for millennia, 
even to many of the intergalactic coteries themselves. Meaning, those that are granted or entrusted with this knowledge are 
few and far in-between. The Lumin Drive is seen as speculative fiction to most of the galaxy, yet the ones who know of it depend on it 
to stay alive.}
